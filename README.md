# Palindrome Checker

This Java program checks if a given integer is a palindrome.

### Example

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.


## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java code using your preferred Java compiler (e.g., `javac PalindromeChecker.java`).
3. Run the program using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) (e.g., `java PalindromeChecker`).
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the integer to check for palindrome.
